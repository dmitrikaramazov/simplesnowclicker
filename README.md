# simplesnowclicker

This was made in one weekend through reading the documentation on SFML's website and watching random short videos. No real tutorials were followed, I just played around with features while reading through the docs.

The only goal of the game is to click on snow boxes to remove them. The score goes up and there is no end. 

You can also resize the screen using your scrollwheel. 

End the game by pressing escape or closing the window.
